# Project Euler #

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical and computer programming problems. This repo contains my solutions these problems in C, Python, and Rust.

`libeuler_test_data.json` contains data used for testing my Project Euler algorithms. The data is stored as `JSON` so it can be easily used across all three languages. `libeuler_test_data.py` is a helper script that loads the test data and drops into the Python 3 REPL for easy modification.
